<p><b>How to make perfect cookies</b></p>
	
	<p><b>Adjusting Ingredients for Perfect Dough</b></p>
	
	<p style="font-family:verdana">Too much flour makes your cookies dry.  If your dough is dry and crumbly,
		add 1-2 tablespoons of additional recipe liquid such a water, milk, cream, or juice.
		You can add softened butter instead, but remember, you're also adding calories.
		Why did this happen?  Improper mixing, mixing too long, too much sugar, too much
		leavening, or not enough egg.  If you add too much liquid, your dough will be too Soft.
		</p>
	
	<p><b>Picking a Cookie Sheet</b></p>
	
	<p style="font-family:verdana">Different cookie sheets give you different baking results.
		Shiny aluminum or stainless steel cookie sheets result in delicate, evenly browned
		cookies.  Insulated cookie sheets give you cookies that may not brown as much on
		the bottom and may cause some cookie dough to spread.  Non-stick cookie sheets make
		cookies easy to remove but the dark finish may cause your cookies to brown more 
		quickly.  Many manufacturers suggest lowering the oven temperature by 25 degrees.
		Dark aluminum sheets have an almost black finish that may absorb heat and cause the
		bottoms of your cookies to brown more quickly.  You may have to lower the temperature
		and bake for a shorter time.</p>
		
	<p><b>Pre-Bake Preparation</b></p>
	
	<p style="font-family:verdana">Grease your pans according to directions, but for moist cookies remember to use only
	a small amount of grease or non-stick spray on the pan.  Parchment paper makes your 
	cleanup quicker, and prevents cookies from sticking.  Bake on heavily greased pans and
	your cookies spread more evenly.  Always start baking with your cookie sheets at room 
	temperature.  If your cookie sheet is warm, your dough may melt and spread out.
	Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart so they don't run together.  If they do anyway 
	and it's an all-butter dough, try 3 parts butter and 1 part shortening the next time.
	Use a small ice cream scoop to "drop" your cookies on the sheet so that the cookies 
	bake evenly and in the same shape.  High-liquid batter spreads more than stiff dough.
	If your cookies are overly flat and thin and you followed all directions, begin your
	next batch with a cool baking sheet making sure that it's not over-greased.  Too much
	sugar can also increase spread.  As a rule, Baker's Sugar and Powdered Sugar reduce
	spread; granulated sugar increases spread.</p>
	
	<p><b>Cooling Cookies</b></p>
	
	<p style="font-family:verdana">Cool your cookies on the cookie sheet.  Place the sheet on a cooling rack for a few
	minutes to firm them slightly before removing them with a spatula or pancake turner.
	If your cooled cookies stick to the cookie sheet, place them into a warm oven for about 
	30 seconds.  For the next batch, either use a clean cookie sheet, or gently wipe the
	the crumbs off the used sheet with paper towels and lightly re-grease it.  Then avoid
	cooling the next batch as long.</p>
	
	<p><b>Storing Cookies</b></p>
	
	<p style="font-family:verdana">Keep soft cookies in a container with a tight lid to retain moisture.  If they are
		a little dry, store them in the container while they're still warm.</p>
		
	<p><b>Freezing Cookies</b></p>
	
	<p style="font-family:verdana">Cool your cookies thoroughly before freezing.  Store each recipe in a separate 
	freezer container that is labeled with the name and date. most will freeze well for up
	to six month.  You can store frosted cookies for up to two month, but we suggest you 
	freeze the cookies unfrosted and then frost them just before serving</p>
